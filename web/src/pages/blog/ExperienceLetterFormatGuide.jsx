const FAQS = [
  { q: "Is an experience letter the same as a relieving letter?", a: "No, they serve different purposes. An experience letter confirms the employee's tenure, designation, and performance — it is used for future employment verification. A relieving letter confirms that the employee has been formally relieved of their duties and has no pending obligations. Most employers issue both on the employee's last working day." },
  { q: "Can I request an experience letter after leaving the company?", a: "Yes, you can request an experience letter even after leaving the company. Write a formal email to the HR department or your former reporting manager requesting the letter. Under Indian labour norms, companies are expected to issue experience letters to former employees. If the company delays or refuses, you can escalate through legal channels, though this is rarely necessary." },
  { q: "What if my company shuts down before issuing an experience letter?", a: "If your company has closed, you can use alternative proof of employment: appointment letter, salary slips, PF statements (EPFO portal shows employer details), Form 16, or bank salary credit statements. You can also obtain a declaration from former colleagues or managers. In extreme cases, a self-declaration affidavit with supporting documents may be accepted." },
  { q: "Should an experience letter mention salary details?", a: "No, a standard experience letter should not include salary details. It covers designation, employment period, and a brief note about conduct and performance. Salary information belongs in a separate salary certificate. Including salary in an experience letter is considered unprofessional and may violate confidentiality norms." },
  { q: "Can an employer refuse to issue an experience letter?", a: "Under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act and general labour law principles, employers cannot unreasonably refuse an experience letter. However, refusal may occur if the employee was terminated for misconduct, has pending dues, or has not completed the notice period. Even in such cases, the employer should issue a letter stating the basic facts of employment." },
  { q: "How do background verification companies verify experience letters?", a: "Background verification agencies (BGV) verify experience letters by contacting the issuing company's HR department. They cross-check the employee's name, designation, dates of employment, and employee ID. Some use digital verification platforms or EPFO records. A letter with inconsistent details, a non-existent company address, or fabricated HR contacts will fail verification." },

      <p style={s.p}>
        An experience letter (also called an employment certificate or service certificate) is a formal document issued
        by an employer confirming that an individual worked at the organization for a specific period. In India,
        experience letters are essential for job changes, background verification, higher education, visa applications,
        and government processes. This guide covers the standard format, essential elements, common variations, and
        provides professional examples you can use as reference.

      <h2 style={s.h2}>What is an Experience Letter?</h2>
      <p style={s.p}>
        An experience letter is an official document issued by an employer that verifies an employee's tenure, role,
        and professional conduct during their time at the organization. Unlike a relieving letter (which simply
        confirms the employee has been relieved), an experience letter provides a broader summary that includes
        designation, department, performance assessment, and a recommendation for future endeavours.
      </p>
      <p style={s.p}>
        In the Indian corporate context, an experience letter is typically issued on the employee's last working day,
        alongside a{" "}
        <Link to="/relieving-letter-generator" style={s.link}>relieving letter</Link>. However, the two documents
        serve distinct purposes and both are needed for most job transitions. Background verification companies
        routinely cross-check experience letters with the issuing organization's HR department.
      </p>

      <h2 style={s.h2}>Essential Elements of an Experience Letter</h2>
      <p style={s.p}>
        A professional experience letter must contain the following components to be accepted by future employers
        and verification agencies:
      </p>
      <ul style={s.ul}>
        <li><strong>Company letterhead</strong> — official letterhead with company logo, name, and registered address</li>
        <li><strong>Date of issue</strong> — the date the letter is generated (typically the last working day)</li>
        <li><strong>Reference number</strong> — a unique document reference for company records and verification</li>
        <li><strong>Employee name</strong> — full legal name as per company records</li>
        <li><strong>Employee ID</strong> — the unique employee identification number</li>
        <li><strong>Designation</strong> — the last held designation at the time of departure</li>
        <li><strong>Department</strong> — the department or business unit the employee belonged to</li>
        <li><strong>Date of joining</strong> — the employee's start date at the organization</li>
        <li><strong>Last working day</strong> — the final date of employment</li>
        <li><strong>Total tenure</strong> — the duration of employment in years and months</li>
        <li><strong>Performance remark</strong> — a brief note on the employee's professional conduct and performance</li>
        <li><strong>Best wishes</strong> — a closing statement wishing the employee well in future endeavours</li>
        <li><strong>Authorized signatory</strong> — name, designation, and signature of the issuing authority (typically HR head or reporting manager)</li>
        <li><strong>Company seal</strong> — official rubber stamp or digital seal for authenticity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={s.h2}>Experience Letter Format: Standard Template</h2>
      <p style={s.p}>
        The following is the standard format used by most Indian companies. The letter should be printed on the
        company's official letterhead:
      </p>

      <div style={{ padding: 24, background: "var(--surface)", border: "1px solid var(--border)", borderRadius: "var(--radius-lg)", marginBottom: 24, fontSize: 14, lineHeight: 1.8, fontFamily: "serif" }}>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}><strong>[Company Name]</strong><br />[Registered Address]<br />[City, State, PIN]</p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>Date: [DD/MM/YYYY]<br />Ref: [COMPANY/HR/EXP/YYYY/NNN]</p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 8, fontSize: 16, textAlign: "center" }}><strong>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN</strong></p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
          This is to certify that <strong>[Employee Name]</strong> (Employee ID: [ID]) was employed with [Company Name]
          from <strong>[Joining Date]</strong> to <strong>[Last Working Day]</strong>, serving as <strong>[Designation]</strong> in
          the [Department] department.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
          During their tenure with us, [Employee Name] demonstrated [sincerity, dedication, and a high degree of
          professionalism / strong technical skills and excellent teamwork]. Their contributions to the team were
          valuable, and they maintained a good professional record throughout their employment.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
          We wish [Employee Name] all the best in their future endeavours.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 4 }}>For [Company Name],</p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>[Authorized Signatory Name]<br />[Designation]<br />[Contact Email / Phone]</p>
      </div>

      <h2 style={s.h2}>Variations by Industry and Seniority</h2>

      <h3 style={s.h3}>IT and Software Companies</h3>
      <p style={s.p}>
        IT companies often include specific project names or technology areas the employee worked on. For senior
        roles, the letter may mention leadership responsibilities, team size managed, or key achievements. Large
        IT companies like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro issue standardized letters through their HRMS portals with
        digital signatures and QR codes for verification.
      </p>

      <h3 style={s.h3}>Startups and Small Businesses</h3>
      <p style={s.p}>
        Startups may not have formal HR departments, but they should still issue experience letters. The letter
        can be signed by the founder or CTO. For early-stage employees who wore multiple hats, the letter may
        describe the broad scope of their role rather than a single designation. Use the{" "}
        <Link to="/experience-letter-generator" style={s.link}>DoAide Docs generator</Link> if you do not
        have an HRMS to generate letters from.
      </p>

      <h3 style={s.h3}>Manufacturing and Traditional Industries</h3>
      <p style={s.p}>
        In manufacturing, construction, and traditional industries, experience letters are commonly called
        "service certificates" and may follow a more formal tone. These industries often include references
        to specific statutory certifications, safety training, or regulatory compliance knowledge the
        employee acquired.
      </p>

      <h2 style={s.h2}>Experience Letter vs Other Employment Documents</h2>
      <p style={s.p}>
        Understanding the distinction between similar employment documents helps both employers and employees
        know which document to issue or request:
      </p>
      <ul style={s.ul}>
        <li>
          <strong>Experience Letter vs{" "}
          <Link to="/relieving-letter-generator" style={s.link}>Relieving Letter</Link></strong> —
          A relieving letter confirms the employee has been formally discharged from their duties with no
          pending obligations. An experience letter verifies the employee's tenure, role, and performance.
          Both are issued on the last working day, and most new employers require both.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Experience Letter vs{" "}
          <Link to="/offer-letter-generator" style={s.link}>Offer Letter</Link></strong> —
          An offer letter is issued at the beginning of employment, offering the position with compensation
          details. An experience letter is issued at the end of employment. Both are used in background
          verification to confirm start and end dates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Experience Letter vs{" "}
          <Link to="/salary-certificate-generator" style={s.link}>Salary Certificate</Link></strong> —
          A salary certificate verifies the employee's compensation details. An experience letter does not
          include salary information. Banks and financial institutions typically require salary certificates,
          not experience letters, for loan processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Experience Letter vs{" "}
          <Link to="/internship-certificate-generator" style={s.link}>Internship Certificate</Link></strong> —
          An internship certificate is for interns who were engaged for a fixed training period, typically
          as part of academic requirements. An experience letter is for regular employees. Read our{" "}
          <Link to="/blog/how-to-write-internship-certificate" style={s.link}>internship certificate guide</Link> for
          the format differences.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={s.h2}>Common Mistakes in Experience Letters</h2>
      <ul style={s.ul}>
        <li><strong>Incorrect dates</strong> — always cross-check joining and last working dates with the HRMS or appointment letter. Incorrect dates cause background verification failures.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrong designation</strong> — use the final designation, not the initial one. If the employee was promoted during their tenure, the letter should reflect the most recent role.</li>
        <li><strong>Missing reference number</strong> — without a reference number, the letter cannot be easily verified. Use a systematic numbering format like COMP/HR/EXP/2026/001.</li>
        <li><strong>Generic performance remarks</strong> — vague phrases like "good employee" add no value. Be specific: "demonstrated strong problem-solving skills" or "consistently met project deadlines."</li>
        <li><strong>Including salary details</strong> — salary information should not be part of an experience letter. Issue a separate{" "}
          <Link to="/salary-certificate-generator" style={s.link}>salary certificate</Link> if salary verification is needed.</li>
        <li><strong>No company seal or letterhead</strong> — an experience letter without a company seal or letterhead will likely fail background verification.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={s.h2}>How to Generate an Experience Letter with DoAide Docs</h2>
      <ol style={s.ol}>
        <li>Open the <Link to="/experience-letter-generator" style={s.link}>Experience Letter Generator</Link></li>

        <li>Fill in employee details — name, ID, designation, department</li>
        <li>Add employment dates — date of joining and last working day</li>
        <li>Write a brief performance remark or use the default professional template</li>
        <li>Add the authorized signatory's name and designation</li>
        <li>Preview and download as a professionally formatted PDF</li>
      </ol>
      <p style={s.p}>
        Print the downloaded PDF on your company letterhead, have the authorized signatory sign it, and
        affix the company seal. The entire process takes less than two minutes.
      </p>

      <h2 style={s.h2}>Tips for Employees Requesting an Experience Letter</h2>
      <ul style={s.ul}>
        <li><strong>Request during notice period</strong> — do not wait until your last day. Raise the request with HR at least a week before your last working day.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify all details</strong> — check your name spelling, employee ID, dates, and designation before accepting the letter. Corrections after issue require re-printing.</li>
        <li><strong>Get both letters</strong> — always collect both the experience letter and the{" "}
          <Link to="/relieving-letter-generator" style={s.link}>relieving letter</Link>. Your next employer will need both.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep digital copies</strong> — scan or photograph the signed letter and store it alongside the digital PDF. Physical copies can be lost or damaged.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify independently</strong> — if you suspect your letter might be questioned, ensure the HR contact details on the letter are verifiable and that HR is aware the letter was issued.</li>
      </ul>
